  <h3>Aim :</h3>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspImplementation of one time pad algorithm to ensure perfect secracy.</p>
  <h3>Procedure:</h3>
  <p>STEP 1 : Select a plain text and a key by clicking on the Next buttons next to the respective fields.<br>

    STEP 2 : If the generated key is biased, make it unbiased in 0 and 1, and use it. You can use the idea given in
    theory part.<br>

    STEP 3 : On clicking on "Encrypt" button, you will get the ciphertext for the same encryption scheme. You can get
    the cipher text for as &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmany plaintext and key pairs as
    you like for the same encryption scheme. You can change the encryption scheme too if you
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwant.<br>

    STEP 4 : You can take a look at all the possible 2^(length of plaintext + length of key) tuples of plaintext, key
    and ciphertext in the next &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspblock.<br>

    STEP 5 : By observing the tuples obtained above, you need to tell if the encryption scheme being used is secure or
    not. If not, you &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspneed to find the message, m and ciphertext, c such that P(M=m|C=c) = P(M=m). In the experiment the
    size of the message &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspspace and that of the key space are equal. Thus from Shannon's theorem, to show that a scheme is
    not perfect, it is enough if &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyou locate two distinct plaintexts that are encrypted to obtain the same ciphertext for
    the same key</p>
