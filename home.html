    <h1><u>One-Time Pad Algorithm</u></h1>
  </center>
  <br>
  <h3>Aim :</h3>
  <p>&nbsp&nbspImplementation of one time pad algorithm to ensure perfect secracy.</p>
  <h3>Theory :</h3>
  <p>&nbsp&nbspVernam proposed a bit-wise exclusive or of the message stream with a truely random zero-one stream which was shared
    by sender &nbsp&nbspand receipient.This cipher is unbreakable in a very strong sense.<br />&nbsp&nbspThe intuition is that any message
    can be transformed into any cipher (of the same length) by a pad, and all transformations are &nbsp&nbspequally likely. Given
    a two letter message, there is a pad which adds to the message to give OK, and another pad which adds to the &nbsp&nbspmessage
    to give NO.<br />&nbsp&nbspSince either of these pads are equally likely, the message is equally likely to be OK or NO.<br />&nbsp&nbspThis
    perfect secrecy comes at a cost, however.The main drawback of the one-time pad cryptosystem, and why it is not
    actually used &nbsp&nbspin practice, is that the secret key must have at least the same length as the message being sent, and
    cannot be reused from one &nbsp&nbspmessage to another.</p>
